CHF 100.000,00, of which 1 share ( Stammaktien ) The Company has also a conditional

of this Agreement, a minimum amount of CHF 150.000.000,00 in words 150 million CHF and maximum 
amount of CHF 450.000.000,00  in words 450 million C HF 
   
(C) The Company’s core business is the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of Green

On the closing of the BCA, the Investor holds at least minimum 3% and maximum 5% of the 
participation shares sum of the Company’s with respect to the issued and outstanding share capital and 
further Participation Shares issuable u nder the Conditional Capital, i.e. on a fully diluted basis.  
   
(E) Considering that:  
   
●  The Euro amount of the Investor’s investment in the Company and the corresponding number of Class

participation Shares and the Investor’s Final Class A participation Shares, if any, from the Investor to 
the Company following the Closing for the nominal value of the number of re -transferred Class A Shares.
   
(G) Accordingly, the BVF Parties intend to undertake and implement the BVF Share Transfers.  
   
(H) The Parties wish to determine in this Agreement their respective rights and obligations in relation to the

Incentivierung von Energie-Effizienz Maßnahmen auf HH-Ebene durch „Emissionsgutschriften“  
Sehr geehrter Herr Heyd, 
 
wir nehmen Bezug auf unser Gespräch vom 18. Juli in unseren Räumen zur Vorstellung Ihres Kon-
zeptes zur energetischen Gebäude- u. Heizungsmodernisierung. Dieses System soll das beste-
hende Heizung-/Energie-System im Bestandsgebäude unter ganzheitlicher Einbeziehung aller ein-
gesetzten, vernetzten Energietechnologien ersetzen. 
 
In diesem Zusammenhang ist eine zentrale Überlegung, alle Beteiligten Parteien zusätzlich zu ei-
nem Austausch zu incentivieren und ferner den transitorischen Prozess durch eine Aufnahme in 
den Emissionshandel zu forcieren und zu unterstützen. Sie hatten uns gebeten, ausgehend vom 
Standpunkt des institutionalisierten Handels, der unser Tagesgeschäft seit über 35 Jahren ist, ein 
kurzes Anforderungsprofil an ein Instrument, also eines Emissionshandelszertifikats, bereitzustel-
len, was wir im Folgenden versuchen wollen. 
 
 
In der aktuellen Phase der vorhandenen Emissionshandelssysteme gibt es keinen unmittelbar an-
wendbaren Mechanismus, innerhalb dessen sich eine Anrechnung von Emissionseinsparungen auf 
Haushaltsebene (privater Haushalte) verwirklichen/umsetzen ließe. Gleichwohl wäre eine derarti-
ge Einsparung von CO2 (e) Emissionen aus dem privaten HH Sektor als Energie-Effizienzmaß-
nahme (EE) im EU ETS noch in Phase II bis vor kurzem innerhalb der flexiblen Mechanismen als 
„Joint Implementation“ Projekt in nutz- und handelbare Emissionsgutschriften (sog. „Emission 
Reduction Units“ / „ERU“) – zur Verwendung im EU ETS als quasi-Äquivalent zu EUAs – umsetzbar 
gewesen. Die Frage der Sinnhaftigkeit des Ansatzes ist damit bereits erklärt (auch wenn diese Art 
von Einsparungen kaum stattgefunden hat, da es grenzkostengünstigere Projekte innerhalb der 
flexiblen Mechanismen gab) und es ist nicht ersichtlich, warum die Politik in der aktuellen

Ausgestaltung der vorhandenen Systeme keine Incentivierung mehr für eine signifikante Einspa-
rung von Emissionen im Bereich der Energie-Effizienz auf HH Ebene bereitstellt. Neben der Finan-
zierbarkeit und Anreizschaffung geht es in diesem Zusammenhang auch um die Verbesserung und 
Skalierung von Technologien, die diverse Multiplikatoreffekte nach sich ziehen würde. 
 
 
Innerhalb des EU ETS gilt das Downstream Prinzip, ein flexibler Mechanismus ist genauso wie die 
Beteiligung Privater nicht mehr vorgesehen. Hinzu kommt, dass der politische Prozess zu einer 
Berücksichtigung bestimmter Sektoren oder projektbasierter Mechanismen komplex, langwierig 
und multilateral ist. Gleichwohl erkennt die EU die Bedeutung der Sektoren Gebäude und Stra-
ßenverkehr im Rahmen der Bestrebungen, Emissionen einzudämmen und zu vermeiden, an und 
plant daher im Rahmen eines „EU ETS 2“ diese einzubeziehen – voraussichtlich aber erst ab 2027 
und in noch nicht festgelegter Art und Weise.  
 
Während es aber für Gebäude aktuell keine zusätzlichen Anreize zur Emissionseinsparung und 
Verwendung neuer Technologien gibt, abseits der Bepreisung der genutzten Brennstoffe, ist dies 
im Bereich Straßenverkehr möglich und private Nutzer können sich jährlich eine Prämie ausbe-
zahlen lassen, wenn Sie von einem Verbrennungsmotor auf ein Elektro-Antrieb umgestiegen sind. 
Dieser zusätzliche Anreiz soll insbesondere zu einem Umstieg auf die Elektromobilität hinwirken. 
Hier gilt das Prinzip des upstreams, um die Verpflichtung auf weniger und institutionale Teilneh-
mer abzugeben; diese geben die Kosten dann über die Preise für die Brennstoffe an die Konsu-
menten zurück, was die Anreize zur Einsparung auf dieser Ebene (zusätzlich) schafft. 
 
Entsprechend ist aus unserer Sicht eine Umsetzung des Anliegens am einfachsten und sinnvolls-
ten analog zu gestalten. Energie-Effizienz Maßnahmen auf HH Ebene kann man in Brennstoffemis-
sionen-Äquivalenz berechnet und entsprechend gutschreiben. Das nEHS gibt in diesem Zusam-
menhang ja auch vor, dass insbesondere die Bereich Wärme und Verkehr hierüber abgedeckt wer-
den sollen, da diese aktuell im EU ETS nicht berücksichtigt sind.  
 
 
Diese Gutschriften sollten dann ebenso an die verpflichtenden Teilnehmer des nEHS bzw. THG ab-
tretbar sein. Hier ist es (zunächst) so ausgestaltet, dass es keine fungiblen Zertifikate gibt, mit ei-
nem Spot- und einem Future Markt, sondern lediglich Emissionsgutschriften in einem elektroni-
schen Register, die zu einem festgelegten und fixen Preis zugeteilt werden (im nEHS ist der Preis 
der Zertifikate während der Einführungsphase von 2021 bis 2025 festgelegt). Aus Vereinfachungs-
gründen ließen sich verschiedene Maßnahmen einführen, um eine zu aufwendige und komplexe 
Handhabung zu verhindern und den Aufwand in Grenzen zu halten – beispielsweise über eine Art 
Schwellwert einer Mindesteinsparung o.ä. . 
 
Ein Markt für die entstandenen Einsparungen würde trotzdem entstehen bzw. besteht ja bereits, 
analog zu dem der THG Prämien für Elektromobilität (wobei diese nicht gehandelt werden

sondern eher durch Broker aufgekauft). Ein wirklicher Handel der Zertifikate wird erst mit der Ein-
führung eines Caps nach der Einführungsphase entstehen.  
 
Ebenso wie im Falle der Elektromobilität sollte der private HH diese Gutschrift veräußern- oder sie 
an den Anlagenbauer abtreten dürfen. Es ist zumindest nicht unmittelbar einzusehen, warum man 
in diesem Bereich einer solchen Handhabung ablehnend gegenübersteht.
